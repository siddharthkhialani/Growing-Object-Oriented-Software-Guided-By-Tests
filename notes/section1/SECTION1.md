# Chapter 1 : What is the point of test driven development

**Test Driven Development:** Your logic should be driven by the tests you write.
Write a failing test and then write the logic to make it pass. Your approach to writing code should be incremental 
and iterative.
Incremental means implementing a feature end-to-end and not in layers(so that your system is always integrated) and 
iterative means refining the feature in each iteration. 


The whole point of test-driven development is to enable you to design a reliable bug-free system. This process helps you
 account for unanticapated changes in your system.
Your code is backed by tests. So adding new features will ensure that the existing ones are working as expected.
Writing a test gives you an immediate feedback about the quality of the design.

Kent Beck : "I was able to separate logical from physical design. I'd been told to do that but no one explained how."


From my personal experience: Incremental and iterative approach not only helps your system always stay integrated but it 
also helps you demonstrate the value added to the system with each iteration.
The first iteration should always be a very basic end to end system backed by basic tests.
